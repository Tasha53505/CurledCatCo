I have a vue website. My candle brand is Curled Cat Co. All of my jars are either Black, white or clear with inverted
label colours i.e black jar = white label. All of the candle names feature cat related names i.e "Idle Hours" is just 
about cats doing nothing all day. the unique thing about my candle brand is that although the branding / jars is basic
Each wax is coloured different, and I also handpaint a wax pawprint onto the top. Now, I already have the vue startup 
created in the workspace. I want to create a modern black and white e-commerce website with Vue. I will buy a domain 
later. I was to use Nexify or vercel to host as it's free, but again that can come later. I will also be using snipcart
as the purchasing as that is free (i.e shopify is not free). Is there anything you need to know before you start
 editing the existing files?
